# Performance hints: for layers: EXTENT [minx] [miny] [maxx] [maxy]
# The spatial extent of the data. In most cases you will not need to
# specify this, but it can be used to avoid the speed cost of having
# MapServer compute the extents of the data. An application can also
# possibly use this value to override the extents of the map.
